/*
 * Ingenic camera SoC RISC-V co-processor: the link between the SoC's
 * QEMU and the core's
 *
 * The core runs in qemu-system-riscv32 (machine ingenic-t31-riscv) and
 * the rest of the SoC in qemu-system-mipsel, joined by a UNIX socket (a
 * chardev on the SoC's side). The SoC's side passes the core the file
 * descriptors of DDR and of the core's SRAM, which both map; every other
 * access the core makes crosses the link and is done on the SoC's bus,
 * its answer awaited.
 *
 * Messages are four little-endian words. The core opens with HELLO; the
 * SoC answers with a MEM for each memory, then IRQ for each raised line,
 * CLOCK and RUN, and after that sends RUN, CLOCK and IRQ as they change.
 * READ and WRITE are each answered by one DATA, which other messages may
 * precede.
 *
 * A T31 core polls the count of its block's OST (T2) in every delay, and
 * some firmware delays forever once Linux has stopped it. The SoC sends a
 * COUNT when the count restarts or changes rate, before the DATA of the
 * write that did it, and the core then reads the count, and the upper half
 * that reading latches, from its own clock instead of across the link.
 *
 * A TNPU core sends WFI as it waits for an interrupt with none pending,
 * with the count of IRQ and RUN messages it has had: the SoC takes it as
 * asleep unless it has sent one since.
